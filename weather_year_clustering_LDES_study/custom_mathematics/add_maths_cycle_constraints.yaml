  cycle_count_limit:
    title: Storage Cycle Count Limit
    description: >-
      The number of cycles for which a storage component is permitted to discharge its capacity across the time horizon of the model. Expressed as a multiple of the installed capacity (i.e. unitless factor)
    default: 10000.0 # by default, permits ten thousand storage cycles
    foreach: [nodes, techs, carriers]
    where: base_tech=storage AND carrier=hydrogen
    domain: real
    bounds:
      min: 0 
      max: 10000
    active: false #defaults to being inactive

  number_year_cycles:
    title: Number of Year Cycles
    description: >-
      The number of years for which the allowable number of cycles occurs over
    default: 1.0 # by default, permits one storage cycle
    foreach: [nodes, techs, carriers]
    where: base_tech=storage AND carrier=hydrogen
    domain: real
    bounds:
      min: 0 
      max: 100
